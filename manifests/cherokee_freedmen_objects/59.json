She stayed in the Chickasaw Nation during the Civil War, returning to the Cherokee Nation approximately 12 years prior to her testimony. Jenetta Harlin testifies that she has known Susan during her entire life in the Chickasaw Nation and that Susan had been married at the time to Bass Harlin, a Cherokee Freedman. Commissioner Breckinridge concludes the testimony by stating that Susan will be enrolled as a Cherokee Freedman by intermarriage on a \"doubtful card,\" but rejects the enrollment of Elizabeth and Calvin Blue, who are not identified in any registry."
