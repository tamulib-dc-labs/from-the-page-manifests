(\"Andy\") Alberty, a Cherokee (\"by blood\"), Cale Wright from Tahlequah District, Jeff Catcher (a.k.a. \"Jeff Tik-nee-sky\"), a Cherokee citizen, and J.W. Alberty, who had previously testified on Martha's behalf. Also includes testimonies from Watt (a.k.a. \"Walter\") Whitmire, son of Johnson (a.k.a.. \"Jonathan\") Whitmire, and Charlotte Wright and Charles Whitmire, the children of Johnson's brother, George. A.J. Alberty testifies that there had been another enslaved person named \"Martha\" on the Whitmire farm prior to the Civil War, who had been sold to a man called Dillingham from Arkansas. He claims that Martha Albert and her family did not go to Texas, but had spent the Civil War in the Choctaw Nation in Red River. The rest of the witnesses discuss their recollections about whether Martha and her mother Nancy had been living on the Whitmire farm prior to the Civil War, and whether they had seen them living in the Choctaw Nation after the war began."
