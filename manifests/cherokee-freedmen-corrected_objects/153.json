The reasoning behind this decision is explained, including how her enslaver, John Harnage, had been a Cherokee citizen prior to 1856, when he took Dollie Umphuris with him to Texas. However, John Harnage did not return to the Cherokee Nation until 1881 and was readmitted as a citizen to the Nation. Dollie Umphuris was also not identified in the 1880 authenticated Cherokee tribal roll. Based on this evidence, the Commission decided that Dollie was not enslaved by a Cherokee citizen when the Civil War started. The Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs recommends that the Commission's decision be approved."
