Jesse testifies that he was formerly enslaved by a Cherokee Indian called \"Dick or Dave Rowe\" from Spring Creek in the Canadian District. He claims that George Starr, his later enslaver, took him from the Flint District to Texas before the Civil War. Jesse returned to the Cherokee Nation (Fort Gibson and the Sequoyah District) several times after the war but continued to live off and on in Texas until 1890, when he returned to reside permanently in the Cherokee Nation. It is decided to place the applications of Jesse and his grandchildren on a 'doubtful card' for further consideration."
