The Indian Office had stated that the evidence presented had been insufficient to prove whether Ed Williams' parents, Pomp Williams and Charity Quinton, were taken out of the Cherokee Nation during the Civil War or returned to it, other than the fact that Ed Williams was born in 1866 in the Cherokee  Nation. In this letter, Ryan states that the Department of the Interior does not agree with the recommendation to reopen the case, and argues that the burden of proof is upon the applicant who did not supply reliable testimony in this case. Due to this reasoning, the Department of the Interior has decided to approve the Commission's original decision to deny his case for enrollment as a Cherokee Freedman."
