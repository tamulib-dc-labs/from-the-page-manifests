He is questioned about Josephine, his then deceased wife and the mother of his daughter. He and his mother also testify about the places that he had resided, including Texas, where he lived off and on for many years.  Neither he nor his daughter were found to appear on the Cherokee tribal rolls of 1880 and 1896, or on the Kerns-Clifton roll. Both of them were placed on a \"doubtful card\" for further consideration."
