The application of Katie Vann, the daughter of formerly enslaved African Americans, for Cherokee Freedmen enrollment for herself and nine of her children (Lou, Robert, Granville, Areminta, Lydia, Florence, Dollie, George, and Ethel Vann) had previously been denied, as it was not proven that Katie's parents had complied with provisions in the ""treaty of 1866"" to return to the Cherokee Nation within six months after the end of the Civil War. Ray and Tessey Vann, also children of Katie Vann, later applied in 1906. None of the applicants could be identified on the Cherokee authenticated tribal roll of 1880 or on any other roll.

However, John Harnage did not return to the Cherokee Nation until 1881 and was readmitted as a citizen to the Nation.
