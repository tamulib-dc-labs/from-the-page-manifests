Parmelia testifies that she was formerly enslaved by Sallie Mayfield, a Cherokee citizen from Flint District, who took  her to Texas as a child before the Civil War, where her children were born. Parmelia testifies that she returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1866 but did not permanently reside there with her children until 12 or 13 years before the time of this hearing. Peter William sand Charles Mayfield, who claims that his former enslaver, Walker Mayfield, was Sallie Mayfield's brother, testify that they saw Parmelia in Fort Gibson about a year after the Civil War.
